# <u>  Apprentice 2 </u>


This is the second apprentice level lab i'm solving. 


There seems to be some  vulnerability in the login function.


On starting the lab we are directed to
![alt text](<images/SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass_1.png>)

Look's quite similar to the previous lab I did. Here we need to go to the login part so we go to the my account section...
![alt text](<images/SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass_3.png>)

On entering we can see the Login page
![alt text](<images/SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass_2.png>)

Let's try testing out a simple SQL injection vulnerability by entering the username as -> admin'-- and password as any value
![alt text](<images/SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass_4.png>)

It didn't work...The username should have been "administrator". <br>
On just replacing that
![alt text](<images/SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass_5.png>)
We now get
![alt text](<images/SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass_6.png>)
Success!!

The part after the admin' in the backend query get's commented out so it won't check for the password.
